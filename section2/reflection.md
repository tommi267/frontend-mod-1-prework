## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I believe asking questions is important. I tend to wait a bit before asking questions as I want to give myself a chance to try and figure it out first.
1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
It made me remember how to do it. I always googled/youtube things I didn't know or understand so I was very comfortable with it.
1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is a statement that only happens when the conditions is met. An example of one for me is  If i have work I have to leave the house at least 1 hr before. An example for a web application would be the the log in where if the credential match it will log you in .

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
else if and else
The program would read the first condition if it doesn't match it would go on to the next condition and will continue this process until it goes thru all the conditions.
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical Operators
&& is use to check if both conditions are met
|| is use to check if either conditions are met
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
None at this time.
