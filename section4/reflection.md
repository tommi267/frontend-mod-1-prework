## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
The Pomodoro technique definitely help me work better.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I feel as I am more focus using the technique.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object has key and value whereas a array is just a list.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array because it's a list. An object if more info was to be added about each student.
  * List of states and their capitals
  An object because all their capitals would be a key:value.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array because it's a list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array because it's a list
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object because the cohort for each student will be a key:value.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object because the amount of each ingredient will be a key:value.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array because it's a list

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
Instagram.
Some of the keys and value are likes and comments.
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Nothing at this time. I am ready to create a web app.
